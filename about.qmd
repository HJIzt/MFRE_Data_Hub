MFRE is a unique one year masters degree combining Economics, Policy and Business as understood from an Agriculture, Food, Natural Resources and Environmental perspective. This professional degree combines the economic rigour of a Masters in Economics, with the business elements of MBA programs, and equips you to analyze real-world environmental issues through applied economics and quantitative skills.

With an ever-increasing focus on empirical studies and data analysis, we have created the Data Hub as a central reference for our students to access tutorials for working on their quantitative skills, as well as curated datasets ideal for work in the Food and Resource sectors.
